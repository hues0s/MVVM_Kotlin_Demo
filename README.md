# Model View ViewModel Demo
Android app demo built using **Model View ViewModel** design pattern.
- It's a simple app that fetches template photos from JSONPlaceholder API, using **Retrofit**, and shows them to the user, using **Picasso** library.
- The app has been built using **Android Jetpack's Navigation component**, which is a new way of creating UIs that provides a better user experience.
- I have also implemented **ktlint**, which is a Kotlin linter that keeps your code clean and organized.
